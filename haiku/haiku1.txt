In a dark, cold room
In an open field
Next to a river
In a damp forest
In a green valley
Between two mountains
In a wooden shed
In my underwear
Under a man's bed
On a stormy sea
In a large fruit bowl
In a clean bathroom
On Times Square, New York
In Putin's closet
Inside a small box
Empire State Building
In a corridor
In a grand hotel
Outside a hotel
Inside the sewers
The streets of Paris
At the VMAs 
Under a blanket
On a frozen lake
In a small birds nest
At the Golden Globes
In a secret cave
In an Apple Store
In St. Petersberg
At a nudist beach
