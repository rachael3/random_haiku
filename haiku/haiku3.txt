As the wind blows gently
While the rain pours down
While a grey wolf howls
While the sea rages
While the moon judges
A deer stops to look
While women giggle
Beliebers fainting
Obama is shocked
Angels are singing
A woman called Steve
Jazz music playing
Hilary Clinton
Cold water dripping
Concealed trouser snake
Buttocks soft and warm
A fart can be heard
Leaves are rustling
An unpleasant smell
With erect nipples
A sticky substance
Glenn Beck is shouting
A man starts weeping
Mermaids comb their hair
The sound of scratching
The end times are here
Miley Cyrus twerks
Kayne interrupts
A distant squealing
A tiny pig walks by
Jay Z starts clapping
Wearing lacy thongs
Men gather pitchforks
