A small mouse cleans its whiskers
Leaves fall gently from the trees
Tulips droop over the vase
Rose thorns scrape my tender skin
Heavy snow falls from the clouds
Glass reflecting bright sunlight
A man is washing his hands
A woman takes off her dress
Tall giraffes begin to fight
An apple falls from a tree
A squirrel drops its only nut
A man is buying cufflinks
Rose petals thrown everywhere
Dali waxes his moustache
Kittens purring in a row
Pirates steal gold and silver
An elderly man is sighing
A programmer drinks green tea
The zombie apocalypse
A man picks his nose secretly
A dog humps a man's leg
Girls dancing in a circle
Nerds discussing Mac products
One Direction fans screaming
A woman frying an egg
Marilyn's skirt blows gently
Tourists stop to take photos
Labradors wagging their tails
A man orders take-away
